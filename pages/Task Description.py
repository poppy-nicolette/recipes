st.write(" The first task is to use the receipt reader. This feature takes you’re an image \n of your grocery receipt and scans it for food items. As your grocery shopping is personal information, we have used a receipt from an anonymous person from a Canadian grocery chain as a proxy for your own. Select the receipt reader from the sidebar on the left. This will activate the receipt reader and show a list of food items to be added to the inventory. Use the attached grocery receipt to compare the results. You should be able to identify food items on the receipt and find their corresponding item on the inventory list. This task is now complete.")
